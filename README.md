# Search Engine

## Assignment Summary
A search engine contains a set of documents. Each document consists of a unique ID and a list of tokens. The search engine responds to queries by finding documents which contain certain tokens and returning their IDs. The program should accept a sequence of commands from standard input and respond on standard output. Commands are terminated by newlines. </br>

There are two types of commands:
<ol>
  <li>Index Command</li>
  <li>Query Command</li>
</ol>
</br>

## Search Engine Commands

### 1. The Index Command
<b><em>index</b> doc-id token1 ... tokenN</em></br>

#### Rules of the index command are:</br>
<ul>
  <li>The index command adds a document to the index.</li>
  <li>The doc-id is an integer.</li>
  <li>Tokens are arbitrary alphanumeric strings.</li>
  <li>A document can contain an arbitrary number of tokens greater than zero.</li>
  <li>The same token may occur more than once in a document.</li>
  <li>If the doc-id in an index command is the same as in a previously seen index command, the previously stored document should be completely replaced (i.e., only the tokens from the latest command should be associated with the doc-id).</li>
</ul>

#### Result:
<ul>
  <li>When the program successfully processes an index command, it should output:</br> 
  <b><em>index ok</b> doc-id</em></li>
  <li>If the program sees an invalid index command (e.g, a token contains a non-alphanumeric character, or a doc-id is not an integer) it should report an error to standard output and continue processing commands. The error output should have the following form: </br>
  <b><em>index error</b> error message</em></li>
</ul>
    
#### Examples:
- index 1 soup tomato cream salt</br>
  - index ok 1
- index 2 cake sugar eggs flour sugar cocoa cream butter</br>
  - index ok 2
- index 1 bread butter salt</br>
  - index ok 1
- index 3 soup fish potato salt pepper</br>
  - index ok 3</br>


### 2. The Query Command
<em>query</b> expression</em></br>

#### Rules of the query command are:</br>

<ul>
  <li>Where expression is an arbitrary expression composed of alphanumeric tokens and the special symbols &, |, (, and ).</li>
  <li>The most simple expression is a single token, and the result of executing this query is a list of the IDs of the documents that contain the token.</li>
</ul></br>

<ul><b>Special Symbols --> &, |</b>
  <li>More complex expressions can be built built using the operations of set conjunction (denoted by &) and disjunction (denoted by |).</li>
  <li>The & and | operation have equal precedence and are commutative and associative.</li>
</ul></br>

<ul><b>Parenthesus --> (, )</b>
  <li>Parentheses have the standard meaning.</li>
  <li>Parentheses are mandatory: a | b | c is not valid, (a | b) | c must be used (this is to make parsing queries simpler).</li>
</ul>

#### Result:
<ul>
  <li>Logically, to execute the query the program looks at every document previously specified by the index command, checks if the document matches the query, and outputs the doc-id if it does.</li>
  <li>However this is suboptimal and much more efficient implementations exist.</li>
  <li>Upon reading the query command the program should execute the query and produce the following output (The doc-ids of the matching documents can be output in arbitrary order):</br>
  <b><em>query results</b> doc-id1 doc-id2 ...</em></li>
  <li>If there is an error, the output should be:</br>
  <b><em>query error</b> error message</em></li>
</ul>


#### Examples:
Examples, given the index commands shown in the example above:</br>

- in: query butter
  - out: query results 2 1
- in: query sugar
  - out: query results 2
- in: query soup
  - out: query results 3
- in: query (butter | potato) & salt
  - out: query results 1 3

## Requirements of the Assignment
Implement a search engine in Java, using some of the data structures you know. You  may use standard and open-source libraries and you may consult online materials or books. Please try to make the implementation reasonably fast, for a fairly large number of documents,say in the tens of thousands (you donâ€™t need to test it on large sets of documents, just think about what this would be for your design). Query speed is more important than indexing speed.
